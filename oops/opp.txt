python is a general purpose programming language 
any realtime entity as a object 
using class we can create object 
class is blueprint to create objects 
once object is created memeory allocation will be allocated 
id(a1)---> we are getting address 
class contains  variables and methods 
to solve realworld problems using object oriented programming
python supporting scripting programming language
python supporting functional programming language
python supporting oops programming language



oops-- to solve realworld problems




clas account:
varaiables and methods
to construct object
a1=account()
id(a1)




# variables ---> are three types -->  static,class , instance 


 #  if variable values are varied from object to object  known as instance variable
 #  if variable values are notvaried from object to object  known as static variable
  // static varaiables are created only one copy and shared to all objects 
  // instance varaiables are created  different varaiables object to onject


  


self is there known as instance method
Declared inside a class ---> known as static variable
we Declared variable outside any instance methods.
@class method decorator is there known as class method
@static method  decorator is there known as static method
 
#methosds: instance method(),class ,static 
methods are three  types--->instance method, class method , static method
variable are three types ---> instance &static & class --> is same as static     



constructor---> is a special method to initialize object values 


# The __doc__ attribute stores the docstring  
# The __doc__ attribute  used to print docstring 


      # #  printing class   info  in the form of dict
