    # variables   are threee types they are  instance variable and static  and local or class

    #  methods are three types --> instance , static ,class
    #  when to use instance variable & static variables
#  any variable value is(varried from object to object) means go with the instance variable
#  any variable value is not  varried from object to object means go with the static  variable
#  static variable    only one copy is going to create  at class  level shared to all objects
