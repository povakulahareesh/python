function ---> inner function --->  function variables and scope-- ananymous or nameless or lambda  function 
then we discuss decortor  and generator-->recursive function  --> means -- calling itself   



what is ananymous function

ananymous function/nameless function:
=========================================
 what is the use of name less or  ananymous function 
 instance use only 
  what is the use of instance use 

  in python we have inbuilt function are there 


these three functions excepting  one function  and one sequence or one iterable as a 

  map() map excepting one function and  one iterator 
reduce() from function tool-->  reduce also ecxepting one function  and one iterator 
filter()-->  filter also excepting one function  and one iterator 

map( function, iterator)
filter ( function, iterator)
reduce ( function, iterator)
reduce ( function, iterator) from functools

====================================================================
ananymous or ananymous  function:
 what  is the need of ananymous function 
 how to create ananymous function in python  using lambda
 the main purpose of ananymous function is  just for instance use 
ex:

def add (q,b):
print (q+b)
add()



no function name  and no function def keyword  and no return statement
ex:

def add (q,b):
print (q+b)
add()

ex:
 we must assign variable for lambda function 

add= lambda a,b:a+b
add(10,20)



what is ananymous function  --> no function name  and no function def keyword  and no return statement


 then what we have to write here--> we are going to use lambda

  what is lambda=---->no function name  and no function def keyword  and no return statement


  syntax of lambda:
  ======================
   lambda arguments  and return expression
   to execute this lambda we are assigning to variable--> we can use any  name
   and we can invoke using variable   
#  we must assign variable for lamda  and print 


    add=lambda a,b:a+b
    print (add(1,2))


 what is the advantage of lambda function----> for instance use 

 advantage of lambda :
 instant use 
 consice code ---> we are going to write very less code 

 by using lambda  we can write short code
 improveing code readability.
    

    ex :
    def calc_age:
    return 2023-year
    print (calc_age(2005))
