 error are three types :
 complile time error
logical error
run time error


compile time error--> we can face those errrors at compile time 

syntatical errors
eg:

missing(:)

logical means ur code gets compiled  ur code also   gives the output  but the problem is it will not be a currect output

logical error:
worng otput 


run time error 
 in runtime error the  code gets compiled  with no syntatical error  tour code is not  acctually giving  you a logical  a well everything is working 

// runtime error means  it can't divide by zero 
eg:
divide by zero

// code was working some where  between we are getting  errror thats our run time errror 
run time:we are gettting errror  at runtime
