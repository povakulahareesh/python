  python is high level ,interpretated  ,gener purpose programming language 

python is a general purpose  high level programming language

what is idle -->integrated learning environment
thonny after vs code and py charm and jupiter note book (jn)



data means python

'''

compiler and interpreter
interpretator--converting from high level to low level
interpreter-->analize source code execute line by line--<python,js
interpreter-->it execute line by line ,python is a interpreter
compiler---> source code execute at a time ,,java ,c,c++
python is a human readable   format code
we convert to 

it is a dynamic programming language and high level and dynamic typed and interpretated pl
--   analyse the hole  source  any syntax error occurs stop the compilation process 

indentation nmeans maintain the bocks

using def keyword we create function 

indentation means we give four spece like    hii


we want to maintain dummy block we use pass method


 class contains variable and methods ,

 comments are non executable executable,
 using .py extension,
 python is based on interpretator,
  we use vs code and tonny,
  identifiers rules ,,,
  should contain a-z,
  A-z
  0-9
  and _ underscore
  should not starts with digits,
  should not use any special characters and symbols
